# Suggestion: Doc Custody Template

## Purpose
Provide a template for suggesting edits to authoritative or planning documents.

## Target
- Document: `GOVERNATOR.md`
- Section: "Doc Custody"

## Problem
The current doc custody section does not describe where suggestions live.

## Proposed Change
Add a "Suggestion Location" subsection:

```
Suggestion Location
- Store suggestions in docs/suggestions/ as suggestion-YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md
```

## Rationale and Impact
Clarifies how workers communicate proposed edits while preserving doc custody.

## Risk / Rollback
Low risk. Revert the added subsection if the location changes.
