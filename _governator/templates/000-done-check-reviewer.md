# Task 000: Done Check (Reviewer)

## Objective
Determine whether the project is complete relative to `GOVERNATOR.md`.

## Required Output
Update `review.json` at the repo root using strict JSON. Set:
- `result` to `approve` if the project is complete
- `result` to `reject` if gaps remain and more work is needed
- `result` to `block` only if the review cannot be completed safely

Include concise comments explaining the decision and any gaps.
